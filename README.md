BouncyBall is a lightweight Java program built to demonstrate to students clearly Swing's animation capability.
It uses JPanel with custom painting (based on a timer using paintComponent) to animate a ball bouncing around
the window.

This project was originally created as a teaching example for the Mayde Creek Highschool Computer Science Club.
Feel free to modify the code, I'd love to see modified forks, more features and polish coming soon.
